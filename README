# About

Kabal is a notification server, like notify-osd, knotify and colibri.


# What makes it different from XYZ?

Hopefully its more sane than most other notification servers out there. My own
frustrations with notification servers fall into one of two categories:

1. They are too disruptive and annoy me (knotify, xfce)
2. They are too lenient and loose some important 
   notifications (colibri, notify-osd)

What does Kabal do differently?

1. It only shows the LATEST notification and no more
2. Notifications can be disabled or called back
3. Critical notifications are alway shown regardless
   of (2) i.e. battery warnings and so on
4. It stores a logfile of notifications during the
   past session


# TODO 

* Multi screen support
* Configurable Widget position
* Sound
* KCM integration for KDE
